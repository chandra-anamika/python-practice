1. Print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string

Sample Input:
	Enter the String -  ABCDCDC
	Enter the Substring - CDC

Sample Output :
	2

Analysis : This has been solved by traversing the String till length of substring from 1st character till the end and increasing the counter if found so.

The length of a string is found by the function len(s), where s is the string.

Solution: stringClassification.py

2. Based on the years of experience, the salaries are predicted using already available data using linear regression.
Sample Input:

Sample Output :
	The predicted salary is  - [68872.93323808]
